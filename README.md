# MudraFon
MudraFon is an innovative interactive tool designed for augmenting the voice of singers and actors, enabling them to dynamically modify their voice in real-time during music theatre performances. 
Using the capabilities of MediaPipe
for face and hand detection, along with OpenCV for webcam feed processing, MudraFon captures head movements,
facial expressions and hand gestures. Through the integration of a gesture detector developed using Mediapipe, along
with a multi-channel vocoder, reverb, multi-tap delay and
reverse delay, implemented in a Max MSP patch, MudraFon
introduces a novel approach to real-time voice controlling
interfaces in the context of music theatre.
Mudrafon’s gestures are inspired from the rich gestural
tradition of Kathakali, with a particular emphasis on the
”Hasthalakshana Deepika”. This ancient text catalogs 24
Mudras (hand gestures) and 9 Navarasam (face expressions)
connected with emotional states (peace, kindness, fear, etc).
MudraFon represents a novel approach to real-time voice
manipulation in music theatre performance, through a synergy between facial expressions and hand gestures, and has
the potential to expand the creative possibilities for the performers.
